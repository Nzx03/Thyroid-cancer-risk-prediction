# Thyroid Cancer Risk Prediction

This project leverages XGBoost to predict thyroid disorders using key medical features, aiding in early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

## Features
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier handling.
- XGBoost model with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- Uses key features like TSH level, T3 level, T4 level, and age for prediction.
- Achieved high accuracy with improved recall for better identification of thyroid disorders.


## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the entire workflow, from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

## Results
- Achieved **85% accuracy** with improved recall for identifying thyroid-positive cases.
- Visualizations included for data distribution, feature importance, and model evaluation metrics.
